Q3) Explain abstract class and interface with an example.

Interface ?
The interface is a blueprint that can be used to implement a class. The interface does not contain any concrete methods (methods that have code). All the methods of an interface are abstract methods.

An interface cannot be instantiated. However, classes that implement interfaces can be instantiated. Interfaces never contain instance variables but, they can contain public static final variables (i.e., constant class variables)


What Is Abstract Class?

A class which has the abstract keyword in its declaration is called abstract class. Abstract classes should have at least one abstract method. , i.e., methods without a body. It can have multiple concrete methods.

Abstract classes allow you to create blueprints for concrete classes. But the inheriting class should implement the abstract method.

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
